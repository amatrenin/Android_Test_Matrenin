<br><b>Unit test</b>
<li>Testing is an integral part of the app development process. By running tests against your app consistently, you can verify your app's correctness, functional behavior, and usability before you release it publicly.</li>
<br><b>ViewModel</b><br>
<br>
<li>ViewModel Data related to the user interface that is not destroyed when the application is rotated. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.</li>
